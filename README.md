A Parotta/Kerala porotta/Malabar porotta is a layered flatbread, originated from the Indian subcontinent, made from maida flour, popular in India. It is originated in Tamil Nadu especially in the central region. It is a common street food in southern India especially in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.. I think its the most tastiest food that I have ever eaten. The usual combinations with porotta are Beef Curry, Chicken Curry, Kadala Curry etc..
