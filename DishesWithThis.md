The most banginest South Indian street food.It is a popular street food from India.It is an irresistible street food of Tamil Nadu that combines both of them in a mish mash of sorts. I am talking about Kothu Parotta. Kothu Parotta is prepared with mixed vegetables that include carrot, beans and green peas, egg kothu parotta calls for scrambling eggs while chicken kothu parotta has chicken pieces with salna gravy going into it. Whatever the variation, I can tell you that it is a hard to resist fast food.Its so spicy and tasty..
