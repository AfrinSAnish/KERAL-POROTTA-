**Making it is an easy process!**

The dough for this paratha is made with all-purpose flour(Maida), egg, sugar, salt, oil, and milk.Egg and Milk ARE added to the dough, as they make the paratha soft.You can skip adding the egg and add some yogurt if you are a vegetarian.The dough is then divided into equal parts and rolled out in a small roti.Once the round roti is made, the circle is cut into thin strips using a knife.The stripes are gathered together and roll to make a ball.This ball is again rolled and cooked on a griddle or tawa using oil or ghee.

Once it is cooked properly, it is pressed from both sides, so that the layers get separated from each other.Pulling The Dough Method...
**You can also make the parotta by pulling the dough.(usually people cook like this in hotels)**

Make the dough as mentioned above. Divide the dough onto equal size balls. Now roll each ball into 6-inch disk.Stack the disks on top of each other. Apply oil over each dish before stacking. Let this stack rest for 20 minutes.Now pull the topmost dough disk from one side and stretch until it forms a long rope kind of shape.Now make a spiral from it and roll the paratha.
